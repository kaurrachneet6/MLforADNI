    # st.write("### Background")
    # st.write("The disease entity known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is now known to represent a collection of overlapping syndromes. A better understanding of this heterogeneity and the ability to distinguish ALS subtypes would improve the clinical care of patients and enhance our understanding of the disease. Subtype profiles could be incorporated into the clinical trial design to improve our ability to detect a therapeutic effect. A variety of classification systems have been proposed over the years based on empirical observations, but it is unclear to what extent they genuinely reflect ALS population substructure.")
    # st.write("### Methods")
    # st.write("We applied machine learning algorithms to a prospective, population-based cohort consisting of 2,858 Italian patients diagnosed with ALS for whom detailed clinical phenotype data were available. We replicated our findings in an independent population-based cohort of 1,097 Italian ALS patients.")
